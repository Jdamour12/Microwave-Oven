# Microwave-Oven

Microwave Oven Simulation - Embedded Systems Project
🚀 Emertxe Internship Project | PIC16F877A | MPLAB IDE | PICSimLab

📌 Overview
This project is a microwave oven simulation developed as part of my Embedded Systems Internship at Emertxe. The system is built using PIC16F877A microcontroller and is designed to simulate the real-world functionality of a microwave oven, including:

Multiple Cooking Modes: Macro, Grill, Convection, and Defrost.
User Interface: A Matrix Keypad (MKP) for input and a 16x4 CLCD display.
Timer & Interrupts: Handling precise cooking durations using Timer0 & ISR.
Safety Features: Door interlocks, buzzer alerts, and controlled heating sequences.
Simulation & Testing: Implemented in PICSimLab with firmware development in MPLAB IDE (XC8 Compiler).

📜 Project Description
The microwave oven system allows users to select cooking modes, set time and power levels, and start/pause/stop the cooking process using a microcontroller-based simulation.

🔹 Features Implemented:
✔ Power ON message display when the system starts.
✔ Keypad-based menu navigation for selecting cooking modes.
✔ CLCD display updates for user interaction.
✔ Interrupt-driven keypad handling for smooth input.
✔ Timer-controlled cooking process for real-time execution.
✔ Buzzer alerts for cooking completion.
✔ Door safety mechanism ensuring proper usage.

⚙️ Hardware & Software Used
🔧 Hardware Components (Simulated in PICSimLab):
PIC16F877A Microcontroller
16x4 CLCD Display
Matrix Keypad (MKP)
Tactile Switch for Start/Pause/Stop
Buzzer for Alerts
🖥️ Software & Tools Used:
MPLAB IDE – Code development & debugging.
XC8 Compiler – Compiling embedded C programs.
PICSimLab – Simulation environment for testing.
🛠️ Installation & Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash

Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/microwave-oven-simulation.git
cd microwave-oven-simulation
Step 2: Open in MPLAB IDE
Launch MPLAB IDE.
Open the project and ensure XC8 Compiler is installed.
Step 3: Run the Simulation in PICSimLab
Load the hex file into PICSimLab.
Connect the required components (CLCD, Keypad, Buzzer, etc.).
Start the simulation and interact with the system!
📌 Note: Ensure proper pin configurations match the circuit design.

📌 How It Works (User Guide)
1️⃣ Power ON: System displays the welcome message.
2️⃣ Mode Selection: User selects cooking mode via keypad.
3️⃣ Set Time & Power: Enter duration & confirm.
4️⃣ Start Cooking: Timer runs, CLCD displays remaining time.
5️⃣ Pause/Resume/Stop: Controlled via keypad inputs.
6️⃣ Completion Alert: Buzzer sounds when cooking is done.

🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Real Hardware Implementation: Extend beyond simulation to physical components.
🔹 Wireless Connectivity: Remote control via mobile app.
🔹 AI-based Cooking Suggestions: Smart optimization of power levels.
